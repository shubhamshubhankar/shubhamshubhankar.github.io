      <h3>Canny Edge Detection(2022)</h3>
      <p>Canny edge detection is a popular edge detection algorithm. The algorithm involves smoothing the image with a Gaussian filter, computing the gradient magnitude and direction, suppressing non-maximum edges, and thresholding using hysteresis.</p>

      <h3>Java-based Text Indexing Application(2015)</h3>
      <p>This is a Java program for text indexing, which takes in a file containing names of files to be indexed, scans each file to extract the words and assigns a document number to each file. It then builds a hash map to map each unique word to the document number(s) where it appears. he program also implements stop word removal and stemming to improve the quality of the indexed words. </p>

      <h3>AutoSource (2019)</h3>
      <p>It can be used for effectively finding the vulnerabilities at very early stage of the SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle). The user can scan the code by just giving GIT repository link into the framework.
AutoSource framework is capable of performing source code review on all platforms(MAC, Linux and Windows).
