        <h2>An adage suggests, "Nothing is; everything is to be".</h2>
        <p>Being honest and humble, I admit and submit that I am continuously in the process of evolving myself whatever I inherited from my father presently working as Principal, a man of principles, a loving father and highly caring household mother, and my younger brother preparing for a career after passing PGDM looking for better prospects
through cracking competitive exams. For as long as I can remember, sports and reading have been my passion. I have spent most of my life either on the playground or with a book. Explore diverse cultures, travel to new places, and history fascinates me. I love to compete with others. Be it football, volleyball, TT, cricket, badminton, or any other sport for that matter. My motto in life is simple, "Build meaningful relationships, do meaningful work".</p>
