        <h3>Software Development Engineer - Vehant Technologies (2020-2022)</h3>
        <p>I worked on the XRay Baggage Scanning System. It uses a dual-energy technique for 6 level color map creation(organic, inorganic, and metallic objects). and machine learning to isolate threat materials (ammunition, sharp objects, explosives, etc).  Here, I introduced various image processing techniques like Pseudo-coloring, super-resolution, anti-aliasing and noise reduction. I also optimized and added thread support to the low-level (C++) codebase  and Python codebase.
